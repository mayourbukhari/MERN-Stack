        This is a practice webpage for the MPA course on Day_006, specifically focusing on DOM manipulation.
        <br>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programming languages to manipulate the content, structure,
        and style of web pages dynamically.
        <br>
        This practice webpage serves as a hands-on example to understand how the DOM works and how it can be used to create interactive web applications.
